# MeteoriteAnalysis
Through out the years, a huge number of meteorites has fallen to Earth from outer space. These incidents are recorded by the Meteoritical Society and stored in a dataset that includes the location, mass, composition, and fall year for over 45,000 meteorites that have struck our planet. 

Such an interesting topic is perfect to be utilized as a study example for data mining techniques we try to learn in our Data Mining project.
The project is implemented using R Studio software.
